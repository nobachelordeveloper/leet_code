Problem Statement:

The problem asks you to check if two given strings are one or zero edits away from being the same. An edit can be an insertion, deletion, or replacement of a character.
Example:

Consider the strings "pale" and "ple". These are one edit away (deletion of 'a').
"pales" and "pale" are also one edit away (insertion of 's').
"pale" and "bale" are one edit away (replacement of 'p' with 'b').
"pale" and "bake" are not one edit away since they require two edits.
Why It's Important:

This problem tests your ability to manipulate strings and understand the nuances of string comparison.
It's a common type of problem to understand if you can handle basic data structures like strings efficiently.
It helps in improving your problem-solving skills in scenarios where you need to find minimal changes required to achieve a goal, which is a common task in software development, especially in features related to text processing or correction algorithms.
Benefits of Solving This Problem:

Enhances your understanding of string operations.
Improves your problem-solving skills for edge cases in string manipulation.
Useful for developing features like auto-correct, search optimizations, and more in real-world applications.
